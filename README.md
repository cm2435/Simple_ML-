# Simple ML 

Implimentations of Machine and Statistical Learning algorithms in python with added Utility, served with a Sklearn style interface. I've started this libary for practice of implimenting algorithms, but will be adding extra functionality sci-kit learn doesn't have out of box, like explainability functions, parallel training and GPU enablement

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push can be found in requirements.txt
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

TODDO- Write docker container deployment using requirements.txt 

TODO- Deploy to pypi so that Library can be downloaded via
    
    python -m pip install Simple_ML-


## Running the tests

TODO- Write the automated tests for check cases using numpy arrays other than examples
TODO- Impliment pandas dataframes to fit and predict models


## Deployment

To use as part of larger codebase simply import Models from Models, for example- 
    
    from Models.supervised_models import Gaussian_Naive_Bayes
